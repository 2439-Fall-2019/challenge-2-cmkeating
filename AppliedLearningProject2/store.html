	<h1>Where can you find your own cool shoes?</h1>

	<p><a href="https://www.goat.com/">GOAT</a>: GOAT is a second hand seller where individuals from across the world can sell their pairs for whatever price they deem fit. Unlike their competition in StockX GOAT offers the ability to sell used pairs, often going for a decent chunck less than new pairs. Another cool feature about this site is that they will have the seller ship the pair to them before you so that they can authenticate them and make sure you get the real thing. The one advantage StockX has is that it gives you much more information than GOAT.</p>
	<br>
	</p><a href="https://stockx.com/">StockX</a>: StockX is very similar to GOAT in that they offer secondhand selling and authenication. The cool thing about StockX is that it is akin to a stock market. It lets you know the details and specifics behind the economics of a pair. How many have sold, at what price, and when. This information allows you to make much more informed decisions on what pair you want and when a good time to buy is. Unlike GOAT however there is no option to buy used pairs.</p>
	<br>
	</p><a href="https://www.footlocker.com/">Footlocker</a>: Footlocker is the most basic level of purchasing. Here you can get pairs that are more general releases. UNlike GOAT and StockX Footlocker doesn't offer secondhand purchases it's all direct from them. Here you can't get the more exclusive pairs like GOAT or StockX but you can still find some cool ones. There are many sites similar to Footlocker like Finish Line or Champs Sports but Footlocker is the most well known.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Where can I find pairs locally?</h2>
	The best locations to find local pairs would be Westroads mall and Nebraska Crossing Outlets.
